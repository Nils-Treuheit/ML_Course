In this repository you find my naive implementaiions of machine learning algorithmns with low-level python.
This Code is written by myself - Nils Treuheit - and shall not be copied or deployed in someones own projects!!!
Please take note that this code is not mature. It lacks excessive testing optimization and so on. 
Also this code is my take on the respective machine learning algorithmns and I highly recommend you to try implement those algorithmns yourself. 
This repository is to be thought of as an inspiring source for tackeling machine learning problems with python.
I hope you understand my intentions and use the code as described.

All the code in this repository is my own intellectual property and I do not permit anyone to use the code itself or snippets for their own code!!!
Your are not permitted to use this code in any way or form other than an thought inspiring source.
I hearby declare this code to be protected by copyright law.

You are allowed to review the code and build your own version of the respective underlying algorithmns.
You can also download and run the code for yourself to get a feeling for the algorithmns and how the programms work.
But again do not use this code for projects and do not use my code and submit it online as your own work.
Any online submissions/uploads of this code and project module usages of this code are not allowed by my lawful right of intellectual property.
