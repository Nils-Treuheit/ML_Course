# ML_Course
In this repository you find my own naive implementaiions of machine learning algorithmns with low-level python. <br>
This Code is written by myself - Nils Treuheit - and shall not be copied or deployed in someones own projects!!! <br>
Please take note that this code is not mature. It lacks excessive testing optimization and so on. <br>
Also this code is my take on the respective machine learning algorithmns and I highly recommend you to try implement those algorithmns yourself. <br>
This repository is to be thought of as an inspiring source for tackeling machine learning problems with python. <br>
I hope you understand my intentions and use the code as described. <br>

All the code in this repository is my own intellectual property and I do not permit anyone to use the code itself or snippets for their own code!!! <br>
Your are not permitted to use this code in any way or form other than an thought inspiring source. <br>
I hearby declare this code to be protected by copyright law. <br>

You are allowed to review the code and build your own version of the respective underlying algorithmns. <br>
You can also download and run the code for yourself to get a feeling for the algorithmns and how the programms work. <br>
But again do not use this code for projects and do not use my code and submit it online as your own work. <br>
Any online submissions/uploads of this code and project module usages of this code are not allowed by my lawful right of intellectual property. <br>

Also please restrain from linking to this code, since it is not mature code and shall not be only used as a referece and starting point for self-studies in the field of Machine Learning. Also again this is my take on these algorithmns I do not claim any of those implementations to be 100% accurate since i myself am only a student and new to this field. <br>


I strongly recommend checking out the "ML - Course_links.txt" file it contains heaps of useful rescources to dive deeper into the topic of machine learning. <br>
I hope you can learn new things and gain some knowledge from all this material. <br>
Have fun with this repositories content :)
